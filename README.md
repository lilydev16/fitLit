## How To Use FitLit
Currently, the FitLit Dashboard displays all information for a random user in our API databases, initiated on page load. The user information is separated into the following sections: user profile, friends list, activity data, hydration data, and sleep data.

### User Profile:
The user profile is located in the top right hand corner, and contains the following:
* User's full name
* Email address
* Stride Length
* Daily Step Goal
* The Average step goal of all FitLit users in the database.

### Friendlist
The friendlist is located in the bottom right hand corner, and contains the following:
* A list of all of the current user's friends by name.

### Hydration Data
Two widgets are used to represent hydration data:
* One widget contains the number of fluid ounces consumed on the current day
* One widget contains the data for how many ounces of water are consumed over a 7 day period.

### Sleep Data
Two widets are used to represent sleep data:
* One widget contains the hours slept, sleep quality, average sleep hours, and average sleep quality for the current date.
* One widget contains the data for sleep hours and quality over a 7 day period.
